							<p>Whether you have lost sight of an old dream or you are searching for a new one within you, Put your dream to test workshop provides a step by step action plan that you can start using today to see, own and reach your dream.

							<p>Potential is a most wonderful word in any language. It is filled with hope and it promises success. Potential is a word based on possibilities. What about unfulfilled potentials?  That word is negative as the word potential is positive. Not reaching your potential is like dying with the music still inside of you. So how can we reach our potential, the answer is intentional growth. Growth doesn't just happen. Are you intentional about your growth? Are you out of your comfort zone most of the time? </p>

							<p>This workshop will help you to grow and develop yourself, so you have the best chance of becoming the person you were created to be. It will also help you to develop the attitude, learn more about your strengths, tap into your passion and become more in touch with your purpose.</p>

							<p>Leadership ability is the lid that determines a person's level of effectiveness. The lower an individual's ability to lead, the lower the lid on his potential. This book was written by John C. Maxwell to answer to the question “if you were to take everything you've learned about leadership over the years and boil it down into a short list, what would it be?”</p>

							<p>The are four ideas that is good to keep in mind when you attend the workshop or read this book.</p>
							<ol>
							 	<li><b>The laws can be learned.</b><span> Some are easier to understand and apply than others, but everyone of them can be acquired. </span></li>
							 	<li><b>The laws can stand alone.</b><span> Each law complements all the others, but you don't need one in order to learn another.</span></li>
							 	<li><b>The laws carry consequences with them.</b><span> Apply the laws and people will follow you. Violate or ignore them, and you will not be able to lead others.</span></li>
							 	<li><b>These laws are the foundation of leadership.</b><span> Once you learn the principles, you have to practice them and apply them to your life.</span></li>
							</ol>


							<p>Whether you are a follower who is just beginning to discover the impact of leadership or a natural leader who already has followers, you can become a better leader. In this workshop, as you learn about the laws, you may learn that you have practiced some of them very effectively. Other laws may expose weaknesses you did not know you had. Therefore, this workshop can be a toolbox to access your leadership. </p>
