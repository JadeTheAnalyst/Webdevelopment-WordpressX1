					<p>What is your dream? Will you achieve it in your life time? I'm certain that you desire to. I'm sure you hope you will. What odds would you give yourself? One in five? One in hundred? One in million? How can you tell whether your chances are good or whether your dream will always remain exactly that a dream? The more work you do to test your dream and to prepare before actually launching out to  accomplish it, the greater the chance you will actually see your dream come true.</p>

					<p class="end-p">Whether you have lost sight of an old dream or you are searching for a new one within you, Put your dream to test workshop provides a step by step action plan that you can start using today to see, own and reach your dream.

					<p>Potential is a most wonderful word in any language. It is filled with hope and it promises success. Potential is a word based on possibilities.

So how can we reach our potential, the answer is intentional growth. Growth doesn't just happen. Are you intentional about your growth? Are you out of your comfort zone most of the time? </p>

					<p>Leadership ability is the lid that determines a person's level of effectiveness. The lower an individual's ability to lead, the lower the lid on his potential. This book was written by John C. Maxwell to answer to the question “if you were to take everything you've learned about leadership over the years and boil it down into a short list, what would it be?”</p>

					<p>The are four ideas that is good to keep in mind when you attend the workshop or read this book.</p>
					<ol>
					 	<li><b>The laws can be learned.</b><span> Some are easier to understand and apply than others, but everyone of them can be acquired. </span></li>
					 	<li><b>The laws can stand alone.</b><span> Each law complements all the others, but you don't need one in order to learn another.</span></li>
					 	<li><b>The laws carry consequences with them.</b><span> Apply the laws and people will follow you. Violate or ignore them, and you will not be able to lead others.</span></li>
					 	<li><b>These laws are the foundation of leadership.</b><span> Once you learn the principles, you have to practice them and apply them to your life.</span></li>
					</ol>


					<p class="end-p">Whether you are a follower who is just beginning to discover the impact of leadership or a natural leader who already has followers, you can become a better leader. In this workshop, as you learn about the laws, you may learn that you have practiced some of them very effectively. Other laws may expose weaknesses you did not know you had. Therefore, this workshop can be a toolbox to access your leadership. </p>

			<div class="class-heading">Mastermind workshops</div>

				<div class="class-description">
					<p>Mastermind workshops are in-depth study that will afford you the opportunity to join forces and mastermind with a unique group of 10 to 15 like-minded individuals who are focused on taking results in every area of their lives to a new level. Having the support and ideas from other focused and driven people allows us to see things differently and to get a new perspective on goals and action plans. As John always says “Everything rises and falls on leadership”. Together in Mastermind group studies, we will learn how to effectively raise our leadership lid consistently. Let's remember that growth is a process, and it only happens when we are consistent and persistent. </p>

					<p class="end-p">The workshops are open to the public, small businesses and corporates. Certificates will be provided by end of each workshop.  If you are not satisfied with the workshop after attending first 3 sessions, you can receive your fee back 100%.</p>
